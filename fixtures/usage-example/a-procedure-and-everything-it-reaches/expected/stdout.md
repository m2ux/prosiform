# Plan Mode

Scopes the solution: the design, the criteria, and the breakdown of an initiative and its epics, and keeps them current as work lands.

Follow the [Procedure](#procedure), adhering to [Rules](#rules) and [Conventions](#conventions) and ensure all [Outcomes](#outcomes) are met.

## Procedure

1. **Take the proposal.**
   - When the user names a proposal, its associated issue body defines the problem scope.
   - When the user names an initiative that already exists, fetch its body with [Read Tracker Issue](#read-tracker-issue). That body defines the problem scope, and no proposal is raised for work it already carries.
   - When neither a proposal nor an existing initiative is named:
     - Follow [Propose Mode](#propose-mode) with the user's goal.
     - Resume this selection step with its published proposal; an unresolved proposal blocks initiative drafting.
2. **Prepare the planning record.**
   - For an initiative, epic or complex plan, apply [Populate Planning Record](#populate-planning-record) with the record identity, folder and supplied evidence files.
   - For initiative or epic planning:
     - Populate a discussion body through [Populate Pull Request Body](#populate-pull-request-body).
     - Apply [Publish Pull Request](#publish-pull-request) as a draft with the planning branch, target, title and body file. Only the user decides to merge that discussion pull request.
3. **Draft each initiative body.**
   - For a new initiative, obtain its proposed prefix through [Select Tracker Number](#select-tracker-number) with the initiative prefix letter.
   - Apply [Draft Initiative Issue Body](#draft-initiative-issue-body) for each initiative with the scoped proposal, confirmed goal clauses, requirement sources, epic summaries and output path. The epics' acceptance criteria carry the detail that makes the initiative's criteria true.
4. **Populate the epics.**
   Apply [Populate Epic Issue Body](#populate-epic-issue-body) for each epic and each new task row.
   - Apply [Populate Work Item](#populate-work-item) for each task with its scope, design, the component its implementation extends, criteria and test requirements.
   - Register each returned file in the planning record.
   - Resolve Open Questions before work starts.
   - Apply [Check Dependencies and Numbering](#check-dependencies-and-numbering) across the drafts and the returned work-item files.
   - Return each epic draft and its format results to the review step.
5. **Review the drafts.**
   Apply [Review Initiative Goal](#review-initiative-goal).
   - Apply [Report Review Finding](#report-review-finding) for each returned finding, with its scope, evidence and proposed resolution.
   - Apply each confirmed resolution to the drafts:
     - For a local epic finding, apply Populate Epic Issue Body with the confirmed Proposal, row and criterion changes, including every new or renumbered criterion in Coverage.
     - For a confirmed distinct concern:
       - Draft its own epic and initiative row.
       - Repeat ordering review for the new epic and initiative row.
   - Record the finding, resolution and decision in the planning record.
   - Repeat Review Initiative Goal with the revised initiative and epic bodies and retained goal clauses and sources. No issue is created while a content or structural finding remains. Unresolved links to unpublished issues are recorded with their intended row identities and resolved during publication; no other finding is deferred.
   - An acceptance criterion is created only once it meets [Initiative Acceptance Criteria](#initiative-acceptance-criteria).
6. **Publish.**
   Put the proposed [Epic Priority](#epic-priority) map for the reviewed epics to the user as an [interview](#rules), the proposal the recommended answer.
   - Take the positive integer the user confirms for each epic.
   - Apply [Ensure Repository Labels](#ensure-repository-labels) with the required definitions, the priority label each confirmed number names among them, before saving the issues.
   - For a new initiative:
     - Apply [Select Tracker Number](#select-tracker-number) with the initiative prefix letter.
     - Save it through [Save Tracker Issue](#save-tracker-issue), using temporary epic-row links until issue identities exist.
     - Save the epics in dependency order, each carrying its confirmed priority label.
     - Replace every temporary link in the initiative and epic bodies with the saved issue identity.
     - Confirm no unresolved epic placeholder remains.
   - Apply [Validate Epic Body](#validate-epic-body) with the saved initiative context.
   - Apply [Validate Initiative Body](#validate-initiative-body) with every saved epic.
   - Resolve findings.
   - Save the corrected bodies.
   - Update the planning record with evidence, decisions and issue links.
7. **Keep the goal current.**
   When the goal, a criterion, a Problem, a Proposal or an epic changes:
   - Repeat Review Initiative Goal with the revised bodies and current sources.
   - Apply Report Review Finding for each finding.
   - Apply confirmed resolutions.
   - Repeat that review until clear.
   - After each round, apply [Check Round of Edits](#check-round-of-edits) to affected bodies.
   - Whenever tasks, edges or a work item's component change, repeat Check Dependencies and Numbering.
     - Put the proposed Epic Priority map to the user again where the edges or the contention moved an epic's number.
     - Save each confirmed change as that epic's priority label.
   - Save affected bodies through Save Tracker Issue, matching titles to current numbers and Coverage to current criteria.
   - Keep local body files as the source for the next pass.
   - Update work-item files and the README inventory for added, renamed or removed tasks.
   - Update the discussion pull request body and planning record.
   - Commit.
   - Push.
8. **Prepare epic delivery.**
   Before any task starts:
   - Resolve every Open Question with the user.
   - Record the answer.
   - Update the affected bodies, removing each settled question.
   - Split multi-condition criteria at the end of the list.
   - Update Coverage for the split criteria.
   - Apply [Check Epic Prerequisites](#check-epic-prerequisites) with current initiative and prerequisite evidence; stop on a failed or incomplete result.
   - After prerequisites pass, apply [Prepare Delivery Bases](#prepare-delivery-bases).
   - Apply [Publish Pull Request](#publish-pull-request) to retarget each affected open task pull request to its epic base.
   - Repeat goal and ordering review on changed bodies before returning readiness.
9. **Record delivered work.**
   When work has landed:
   - Follow [⇉ Sync Mode](modes/sync-mode.md) for the affected initiative.
   - For an unplaced task issue:
     - Add its row through Populate Epic Issue Body.
     - Save that body.
     - Repeat Sync Mode with the refreshed epic.
   - Return the saved delivery state or blockers.

## Outcomes

- **A scoped initiative.**
  The user has an initiative scoped to the proposal they named, or to a proposal raised for that problem.
- **Several initiatives.**
  One proposal may become several initiatives. A partition by solution maturity, such as an MVP demo, a functional prototype, and a production-intent version, is an example of that result. Those initiatives may run in series or in parallel. The example does not limit the partition.
- **A goal made true.**
  Each clause of the goal the user confirmed is made true by the initiative's criteria, and the epics the initiative lists are the work that delivers those criteria.
- **Epics that start together.**
  The user has settled which of the initiative's epics start alongside each other, from a proposal the dependency graph makes.
- **Review before creation.**
  Findings on that initiative are folded in before any of its issues are created.

# Rules

- **Decisions.**
  A question the user must decide is put as an interview, one question at a time. A decision the run's [allowance](#allowance) covers is taken with its recommended option rather than asked. Record each decision in the affected issues and, when there is one, the planning record.
  - A plain-language paragraph before the question gives the context the user needs to answer it.
  - The question offers more than one choice. The recommended choice is marked on its option.
  - Wait for the user's answer. An unanswered question stays pending. A recommendation or elapsed time supplies no answer.
  - The user can select Other and specify a response beyond the options.
  - Use the native tool for presenting the question when one is available.
- **Bootstrap.**
  A link whose text opens with a symbol is compiled and used as the [bootstrap](#bootstrap) states.
- **Layers.**
  Modes, protocols, artifacts. A mode aggregates protocol calls, as an application calls services; a protocol applies artifact operations and follows other protocols; an artifact does neither. A call goes down the stack, never up. A mode reaches an artifact operation directly only where no protocol owns that change.
- **Execution.**
  A call passes its named inputs. A protocol is one change that lands in several artifacts together, and is followed whole. Follow another mode, a protocol or a named procedure subsection, and apply an artifact operation, only where the procedure calls for it; finish that call and return its result before continuing, unless the procedure explicitly dispatches concurrent work.

# Conventions

- **Session.**
  Once per session, before the first `gh` call, unset `GH_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` so `gh` uses its keyring login. Where shell state does not persist between commands, confirm instead that neither is set in the shell profile.
- **Repository.**
  `gh` resolves `{owner}/{repo}` from the git remote of the directory it runs in, so run `gh` commands inside a checkout of the repository that holds the issues. `{other}` is a further repository the board's issues live in.
- **Bodies.**
  - Bodies and long comments always go through a file (`-F body=@file`), never inline, which avoids quoting.
  - **Example.**  workflow-server's dynamic-shell restrictions deny a body inlined in the command.
  - Keep these files in a working directory outside the repository.
- **Scripts.**
  Scripts run under `sbx`, invoked by its absolute path from `<workspace>`, the checkout holding this skill.
- **Boards.**
  A project board sits under `users/{owner}`, or `orgs/{owner}` when `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo} --jq .owner.type` is `Organization`.
- **Example values.**  Substitute the real ones:
  - `936` an initiative issue, `943` and `937` its epics, `637` a task issue, `874` an orphan, `946` an initiative off the board, `960` a proposal;
  - `950` a pull request, `I07` and `I08` initiative numbers;
  - board `9`, workflow-server's Canon theme, and `419167630` its Status field id;
  - `1` the Initiative Template board, `13` a board copied from it;
  - `14` the Proposals Template, `15` the Proposals board;
  - `m2ux` the user.
  - `<checkout>` any checkout of the project, a linked worktree included.

# Artifacts

## Issue

### Operations

#### *Read* Tracker Issue

The current issue, its saved body and discussion.

**Inputs:** Repository, issue number and output files; whether discussion is needed.

1. Run [Fetch Tracker Issue](#fetch-tracker-issue) for the complete JSON, or [Fetch Issue Body](#fetch-issue-body) for its body, with the issue number and destination file.
2. Run [Fetch Issue Comments](#fetch-issue-comments) when the request depends on the discussion.

#### *Save* Tracker Issue

One populated body and its metadata, written to the tracker.

**Inputs:** Repository, optional existing issue number, populated body file, title and existing labels for creation; selected body or metadata changes for an existing issue. Optional comment file.

1. Take the supplied body and metadata, preserving each field the caller does not change for an existing issue.
2. Return a missing-label result when an assignment names a label the repository does not contain.
3. For a new issue, run [Create Tracker Issue](#create-tracker-issue) with the body's file, title and labels.
4. For an existing issue, run [Patch Issue Body](#patch-issue-body), [Retitle Tracker Issue](#retitle-tracker-issue), [Add Issue Labels](#add-issue-labels) or [Remove Issue Label](#remove-issue-label) for the fields being changed.
5. Apply [Comment on Issue](#comment-on-issue) for an answer or a preserved body the caller requires, with the issue number and comment file.
6. Re-read with [Fetch Tracker Issue](#fetch-tracker-issue).
7. Compare the saved fields with the intended body and metadata.

#### *Close* Tracker Issue

Verified completion of an issue and its linked delivery.

**Inputs:** Issue identity, successful normal delivery result, current issue JSON, complete Development snapshot, confirmed repository setting and fresh linked pull request records.

1. Apply [Capture Issue Development](#capture-issue-development) for the issue's complete links and confirmed repository setting.
2. Take the caller's fresh records for every linked pull request, across repositories and states; return missing evidence to the caller.
   - Confirm GitHub's **Auto-close issues with merged linked pull requests** setting is disabled before any delivery pull request is linked or merged. An enabled or unknown setting blocks those actions until configuration is confirmed. Changing repository settings requires explicit authorization.
   - Use the issue's entire Development field to establish membership. Titles, branch names, body mentions and a list filtered to one initiative do not establish completeness. An explicitly empty field adds no pull request requirement.
3. Run [Check Issue Closure](#check-issue-closure) with `--issue`, `--development`, and `--prs` for those fresh records.
4. Require normal delivery checks to pass, every criterion to be verified and ticked, and every currently linked pull request to be merged.
   - Keep the issue open for an open, draft, closed without merge, or unreadable linked pull request.
   - Obtain the user's decision before removing an abandoned or incorrect Development link. A replacement pull request does not remove the requirement on a link still present.
5. Apply [Close as Completed](#close-as-completed), which repeats the gate immediately before the write. A changed link set requires another capture and check.

#### *Comment* on Issue

The supplied discussion text saved on one issue.

**Inputs:** Repository, issue number and exact comment text or file; reviewer identity and addressed feedback when replying to a review.

1. When replying to feedback already folded into the body, compose a precise, factual reply addressing each point and mentioning the reviewer, with no thanks or filler. Name what the body now says, by criterion id where one carries it, or the issue that takes the point.
2. Publish the supplied comment:
   - For a one-line comment, run [Post Inline Comment](#post-inline-comment) with the exact text.
   - For a longer comment, run [Post Comment File](#post-comment-file) with the complete file.
3. Return the saved comment URL.

#### *Close* as Completed

An issue closed after its final evidence check.

**Inputs:** Repository, issue number, authenticated access, confirmed repository auto-closing setting, passing normal delivery checks and absolute paths to the current issue, Development and linked pull request evidence.

1. Apply [Capture Issue Development](#capture-issue-development) immediately before closure with the issue identity, authenticated access, confirmed repository setting and evidence paths.
2. Compare its links with the supplied fresh pull request records; return a changed link set or missing evidence to the caller for refresh.
3. Run [Check Issue Closure](#check-issue-closure) with the current issue, Development and linked pull request files, using absolute evidence paths when changing directory.
4. Require exit 0 and passing normal delivery checks; a sync report of closable does not permit skipping this gate.
5. Immediately after the gate passes, run [Set Completed State](#set-completed-state) with the issue's repository and number and the passing evidence.
6. Return the saved state or failure.

#### *Capture* Issue Development

The issue's current content and complete Development snapshot.

**Inputs:** Issue identity, authenticated access, observed repository auto-closing setting and issue and Development output paths.

1. Apply [Read Issue Development](#read-issue-development) for the entire field across repositories and states. An inaccessible field returns incomplete evidence; an empty array means the field was checked and empty.
2. Run [Write Development Snapshot](#write-development-snapshot) with the issue identity, observed link set, completeness result and repository setting, saving `development-943.json` or the supplied path.
   - Set `complete` true only after the full read, and `auto_close_issues` false only after the repository setting is confirmed disabled.
3. Run [Fetch Tracker Issue](#fetch-tracker-issue) into `issue-943.json` or the supplied path.
4. Return both files and any incomplete evidence. The caller supplies fresh linked pull request records in `development-prs-943.json`.

#### *Read* Issue Development

The Development links observed for one issue through authenticated GitHub.

**Inputs:** Issue identity and authenticated access.

1. Read every page and state, across repositories, recording each linked pull request's identity.
2. Return the observed links and whether the entire field was readable.

#### *Confirm* Repository Auto-Close

Whether the repository auto-closes issues whose linked pull requests merge, established for this session.

**Inputs:** Repository and authenticated access.

1. Read the setting where the authenticated API exposes it, and take a read value as the answer.
2. Where no API field carries it, put the setting to the user and take their explicit answer, meeting [Auto-Close Setting](#auto-close-setting).
3. Return the confirmed value. An unconfirmed setting is a blocker, and an enabled one leaves the caller to obtain authorization before the repository is reconfigured.

#### *Select* Tracker Number

The next unused number for one prefixed issue kind in the repository.

**Inputs:** Repository, the kind's prefix letter and its existing titles.

1. Run [List Prefixed Titles](#list-prefixed-titles) for the supplied repository and prefix letter, covering all issue states.
2. Read the highest prefix carrying that letter.
3. Confirm the following number, or `00` when there is no prefix, remains unused before creation.
4. Return the confirmed number.

### Fields

#### Auto-Close Setting

GitHub's **Auto-close issues with merged linked pull requests** repository setting, which must be disabled before a delivery pull request is linked or merged, so that closure follows the criteria rather than the merge.

- The setting is confirmed per repository and holds for the session; it is not inferred from an issue that stayed open.
- No REST field and no GraphQL field of `gh` 2.46 carries it, so on such a host the user's explicit answer is the only source.
- An enabled setting closes issues on merge whatever their criteria. Where it cannot be disabled, each affected issue's state is read after every merge and reopened where its criteria are unmet.

### Commands

#### Create Tracker Issue

Creates an issue from a body file, with its title and labels, and prints its number.

**Inputs:** Repository, populated body file, title and existing label names.

Repeat `-f 'labels[]=<label>'` for each supplied label.

```bash
gh api --method POST 'repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues' -f title='<title>' -F 'body=@<body-file>' -f 'labels[]=<label>' --jq .number

```

#### Fetch Issue Body

Saves an issue's body alone.

**Inputs:** Repository, issue number and destination file.

```bash
gh api 'repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<issue-number>' --jq .body > '<output-body-file>'
```

**Example:**

```

**Example:**

```bash
gh api --method POST 'repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/943/labels' -f 'labels[]=<label>' --jq '.[].name'
```

#### Remove Issue Label

Removes one label from an issue.

**Inputs:** Repository, issue number and label name.

```bash
gh api --method DELETE 'repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<issue-number>/labels/<label>' --jq '.[].name'
```

**Example:**

```bash
gh api --method DELETE 'repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/943/labels/<label>' --jq '.[].name'
```

#### Fetch Issue Comments

Prints an issue's comments.

**Inputs:** Repository and issue number.

```bash
gh api --paginate 'repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<issue-number>/comments'
```

**Example:**

```bash
gh api --paginate 'repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/874/comments'
```

#### Fetch Tracker Issue

Saves an issue whole, as JSON, for the scripts that read issues.

**Inputs:** Repository, issue number and destination JSON file.

```bash
gh api 'repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<issue-number>' > '<issue-json-file>'
```

**Example:**

```bash
gh api 'repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/943' > issue-943.json
```

#### Check Issue Closure

Checks the issue criteria, the complete link snapshot and every linked pull request.

**Inputs:** Current issue JSON, complete Development snapshot and fresh linked pull request records.

- `--issue`, `--development`, and `--prs` are the fresh issue JSON, Development snapshot, and linked pull request records.
- Exit 0 means the closure gate passes; normal delivery checks must also pass. Exit 1 reports blockers. The command performs no network calls or writes.

```bash
cd "<workspace>" && "<workspace>/scripts/sbx" python3 skills/work-planner/scripts/closure.py --issue '<issue-json-file>' --development '<development-snapshot-file>' --prs '<linked-pull-request-records-file>'
```

**Example:**

```

**Example:**

```bash
gh api --method POST 'repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/874/comments' -F body=@comment-874.md --jq .html_url
```

#### Set Completed State

Sets an issue to closed with the completed reason and returns its state.

**Inputs:** Repository, issue number, passing normal delivery checks and an immediately preceding successful closure gate on current evidence.

```bash
gh api --method PATCH 'repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<issue-number>' -f state=closed -f state_reason=completed --jq .state
```

**Example:**

```bash
gh api --method PATCH 'repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/943' -f state=closed -f state_reason=completed --jq .state
```

#### Write Development Snapshot

Saves an observed Development field and repository setting as JSON.

**Inputs:** Repository and issue number, observed links, completeness result, confirmed or unknown auto-closing setting and destination file.

Write the supplied values in this shape. Substitute the issue number as a JSON integer, completeness as a boolean, and the auto-closing setting as a boolean or `null` when unknown. Supply every observed pull request URL, or an empty array when there are none. Preserve incomplete evidence as incomplete.

```text

  "auto_close_issues": <auto-close-issues>,
  "pull_requests": ["<pull-request-url>"]
}
```

**Example payload:**

```json
{
  "repo": "owner/repo",

  "pull_requests": ["https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/980"]
}
```

#### List Prefixed Titles

**Inputs:** Repository owner and name, and the kind's prefix letter.

```bash
gh api --paginate 'repos/<owner>/<repository>/issues?state=all&per_page=100' --jq '.[] | select(.title | test("^\\[<prefix-letter>[0-9]{2}\\]")) | .title'
```

**Example:** Initiatives in one repository.

```bash
gh api --paginate 'repos/m2ux/workflow-server/issues?state=all&per_page=100' --jq '.[] | select(.title | test("^\\[I[0-9]{2}\\]")) | .title'
```

## Planning Record

A planning record is a folder. README.md is its entry point: it answers what the work is, and links to every other artifact the plan produces. Each artifact is the home of its own content. The progress of the work is the theme's project board.

### Operations

#### *Populate* Planning Record

One planning directory and its artifact inventory.

**Inputs:** Record identity, folder path and supplied artifact files and links.

1. Prepare the selected record:
   - For a new record:
     - Create the folder with [Add Planning Record](#add-planning-record).
     - Populate README.md from the [Template](#template).
   - For an existing record:
     - Read its README, retaining its creation date, other artifacts and links.
     - Update only the supplied content.
   - The folder must meet [Layout](#layout).
   - All populated README fields must meet [Fields](#fields-1).
2. Register the artifact files supplied by the caller, using their chosen names.
   - Each file must have a row meeting [Layout](#layout) and [Artifacts](#artifacts-1).
   - File content remains supplied by the caller; this operation does not author that artifact's content.

#### *Publish* Planning Record

The record's folder committed and pushed, so every link into it resolves for a reader.

**Inputs:** Planning-folder path, the files written into it and a commit message file.

1. Run [Find Engineering Worktree](#find-engineering-worktree) for the path the record is written on.
2. Run [Commit Planning Record](#commit-planning-record), which stages and commits that folder in one call.
   - Confirm the commit holds the files this record wrote, meeting [Shared Worktree](#shared-worktree).
3. Run [Push Engineering Branch](#push-engineering-branch).
   - Report a push that will not fast-forward rather than rewriting the branch.

### Fields

#### Template

```markdown
# [Descriptive name] — [Month Year]

> [Classifier] · Created [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Executive Summary

[Two paragraphs on the purpose of this work and why it matters.]

## Artifacts

| Artifact | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| [Name](file.md) | What this artifact holds |

## Links

| Resource | Link |
| --- | --- |
| [External reference] | [link] |
```

#### Shared Worktree

The engineering branch has one worktree and every session writes its records there, so they share one index. A commit therefore names the folder it is for, and a session confirms its own files landed in its own commit rather than assuming the index held only its staging.

#### Layout

README.md is the one file the folder must hold. Any file beyond README.md is added as the work needs it.

```text
./
├── README.md
└── …
```

Each file beyond README.md is a row in the README's Artifacts.

#### Header

One blockquote: the classifier, the day the record was created, and a revised date when the README is updated after the work is done.

#### Executive Summary

Two paragraphs: the purpose of this work, and why it matters.

#### Artifacts

- One row for every artifact in the record other than README.md, added when the file is produced.
- The link sits on the artifact's name. The row says what the artifact holds, and the artifact is the home of that content.

#### Links

External references only: a tracker issue, a parent epic, a pull request. An artifact of this plan is an Artifacts row.

### Commands

#### Find Engineering Worktree

Prints the checkout holding the engineering branch, which is where every planning record is written.

**Inputs:** Any checkout of the project.

- The engineering branch has one long-lived worktree and takes no further one.

```bash
git worktree list | grep '\[engineering\]'
```

#### Commit Planning Record

Stages and commits one planning folder on the engineering worktree.

**Inputs:** Engineering worktree, planning-folder path and a commit message file.

- Staging and committing are one call, and the commit names its folder, so a concurrent session's staged work cannot ride along. See [Shared Worktree](#shared-worktree).
- Pass the message through a file; the worktree is a linked one, so git writes here run unsandboxed.

```bash
cd '<engineering-worktree>' && git add '<planning-folder-path>' && git commit -F '<message-file>' -- '<planning-folder-path>'
```

**Example:**

```bash
cd .engineering && git add artifacts/planning/2026-10-15-950-queue-plan && git commit -F msg.txt -- artifacts/planning/2026-10-15-950-queue-plan
```

#### Push Engineering Branch

Publishes the engineering branch so a record's links resolve.

**Inputs:** Engineering worktree.

- Planning records go straight to the branch; they take no pull request.

```bash
cd '<engineering-worktree>' && git push
```

#### Add Planning Record

Adds the folder for one planning record on the long-lived engineering worktree.

**Inputs:** Engineering worktree and planning-folder path composed from the date, optional issue or pull request number, and slug.

- `<planning-folder-path>` is `artifacts/planning/<yyyy-mm-dd>[-<ref>]-<slug>/`. The date is the day the record is opened.
- `<ref>` is the bare number of the issue or the pull request the record is for. A record for ad hoc work, which has neither, has no ref segment.
- The slug is lowercase words separated by hyphens, a short name of the work.
- The folder's files are the [planning layout](#layout).
- Edits are made on that worktree. The engineering branch takes no further worktree and no branch.

```bash
mkdir -p '<planning-folder-path>'
```

**Example:**

```bash
mkdir -p artifacts/planning/2026-10-15-950-queue-plan
```

## Pull Request Body

### Operations

#### *Populate* Pull Request Body

One pull request body from supplied change and validation evidence.

**Inputs:** Change summary, supplied delivery scope, validation evidence, optional current body and output path.

1. Populate the body from the [Template](#template-1) using the change and its evidence, using [Populate Review Body](#populate-review-body) for an epic review.
   - All populated fields must meet [Fields](#fields-2).
2. Verify each result link against [Test Plan](#test-plan) before publishing the body.
3. Return the complete body file and any unresolved evidence links to the caller for publication.

#### *Populate* Review Body

The current change carried by one epic base.

**Inputs:** Current base change, supplied task-merge evidence and optional existing review body.

1. Populate the review body from the [Template](#template-1) using the actual task merges into the base.
   - All populated fields must meet [Fields](#fields-2), including the review-specific requirements in [Review Body](#review-body).
2. For a later task merge:
   - Add its functional change under the corresponding area.
   - Cite the merged task pull request as the next reference.
3. Return the complete updated body file to the caller.

### Fields

#### Template

````markdown
## Overview

{{One paragraph: what this pull request delivers and why.}}

## Changes

{{One sentence on what changed and why it was needed. Then one heading per area the changes sit in. A heading is two to five words, in title case, such as Queue Placement or Task Readiness. Under each heading, one bullet per functional change in that area. The bullet opens with a bold lead, as the scheme's Bold leads rule lays one out. The change is at most two lines, the lead included: the lead names what it does, and the behavior is the single line under it.}}

### {{Queue Placement}}

- **{{What it does.}}**
  {{The behavior as it is.}}

## Test Plan

| Test | Description | Coverage | Pass |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T1 | {{Check name, per [Test Plan](#test-plan).}} | {{Observed criteria, if any.}} | [{{Result}}]({{Planning document URL#test-section}}) |

## Open Questions

- {{An undecided point. Resolve it, then delete the section.}}

## References

- **R1.** [{{Title}}]({{URL}}) — {{What the reader finds there. The issue this pull request delivers is not a reference: the Development field carries that link, as [Issue Links](pull-request.md#issue-links) state. Delete the section when there is none.}}
````

#### Titles

- A pull request's title starts with the epic it works on: `[I07:E00] Purpose`.
- A pull request working on no epic takes `Name: Subtitle`, with no prefix, as a revision of the skill itself does.
- The prefix is how an epic's pull requests are found, and each one, open or merged, is matched to the tasks it works on from its changes and the tasks' Descriptions.
- The pull request that merges an epic base carries the same prefix. Its head is the epic base, which tells it from a task pull request.

#### Review Body

- Overview is one paragraph on what the base carries.
- Changes holds one heading per area, with a bullet per functional change.
- References cites each task pull request merged into that base.
- It carries no Test Plan, since it delivers no task of its own, and no statement about what the epic has yet to deliver. The epic's Work Breakdown is where delivery state is read.

#### Test Plan

A task pull request carries a Test Plan.

- **Table.**
  The pull request's Test Plan section contains only one table, with columns Test, Description, Coverage and Pass, in that order.
- **Columns.**
  - Test names the id.
  - Description briefly names the check.
  - Coverage names the criteria the check observes, `AC1, AC3`, and is empty when the check observes none.
  - A row whose Test cell is empty names a criterion no check observes, and its Pass cell is empty.
  - Pass is empty while a check awaits a result. A recorded result uses ✓ when the check ran and held, or an accurate label such as Partial, Fail or Not run.
- **Evidence.**
  - Test procedures, tested revisions, observations, limitations and supporting evidence belong in the work's published planning document.
  - Each recorded result in Pass links to its relevant section in that document, using the result as link text: `[✓](URL#check)` or `[Partial](URL#check)`.
  - Each evidence link is accessible to the pull request's readers and resolves to the intended section.
- **Completion.**
  The test plan has passed when every row with a Test id carries ✓ as its result. Partial, failed and unexecuted checks remain incomplete.

#### Test Coverage

- Every criterion a unit's Coverage names has an observing test in its work item and pull request. A criterion no test can observe remains in the [coverage report](#coverage-reports) and in a test-plan row with an empty Test cell.
- The criterion selects the test kind: a unit test for one component, an integration test for a seam between components, and an end-to-end or system test for running-system behaviour. That evidence meets [Coverage Reports](#coverage-reports).
- An instrument that does not exist yet is work the task carries, as the verified rule defines. Use the project's own system test where it can observe the criterion.
- One row per check, in execution order, followed by any unobserved criteria. Every criterion in the unit's Coverage appears in at least one row.

## Pull Request

### Operations

#### *Access* Development Links

The observed or updated Development relation for a pull request.

**Inputs:** Pull request identity, authenticated access and requested relation read or write; for an edit, the issue identity, confirmed repository prerequisite and any user decision authorizing removal of an abandoned or incorrect link, meeting the applicable preconditions in [Close Tracker Issue](#close-tracker-issue).

1. Run [Read Development Links](#read-development-links) for the actual field, including every page and state. A missing tool or inaccessible field is a blocker, not an empty link set.
2. Return the complete relation for a read-only request.
3. For a link edit:
   - Take the supplied repository prerequisite from [Confirm Repository Auto-Close](#confirm-repository-auto-close); an unconfirmed setting blocks the edit.
   - For an addition, run [Set Development Link](#set-development-link) with the pull request and issue identities.
   - For removal of an abandoned or incorrect link:
     - Require the supplied user decision.
     - Run [Remove Development Link](#remove-development-link) with those identities.
4. Run [Read Development Links](#read-development-links) again for the same pull request.
5. Compare the field with the intended edit.
6. Return the verified relation or discrepancy.

#### *Fetch* Pull Request Issue Links

The complete issue-link snapshot for a supplied set of pull requests.

**Inputs:** Current pull request records, authenticated access and destination link-snapshot file.

1. For every pull request in `prs.json`, apply [Access Development Links](#access-development-links) with a read-only request and its identity. An observed empty field supplies an empty array; an unreadable field leaves the fetch incomplete.
2. Repeat that read after a link changes.
3. If any relation is unreadable, return the incomplete result.
4. Run [Write Pull Request Links](#write-pull-request-links) with the observed complete relations and destination `links.json`, including one entry per pull request and every linked issue's repository and number.
5. Return the snapshot for the scripts' `--links` input.

#### *Link* Pull Request to Issue

The verified delivery-issue relation for a pull request.

**Inputs:** Pull request identity, delivery issue identity, current pull request records, link-snapshot destination, authenticated access and the caller's confirmed repository prerequisite documented in [Close Tracker Issue](#close-tracker-issue).

1. Apply [Access Development Links](#access-development-links) with the supplied identities, requested link addition and confirmed repository prerequisite.
2. Stop on a blocker or an unverified edit.
3. Apply [Fetch Pull Request Issue Links](#fetch-pull-request-issue-links) with the current records and destination after the edit.
4. Return the verified relation and refreshed snapshot.

#### *Read* Pull Request State

One current pull request and its requested supporting records.

**Inputs:** Repository, pull request number, output paths and requested records: metadata, changed paths or reviews.

1. Run [Fetch Pull Request](#fetch-pull-request) or [Save Pull Request Snapshot](#save-pull-request-snapshot) for current identity, state, head and base.
2. Run [Fetch Pull Request Files](#fetch-pull-request-files) or [Fetch Pull Request Reviews](#fetch-pull-request-reviews) when the caller requests those records.
3. Return the snapshots or missing evidence.

#### *Publish* Pull Request

One pull request created or updated from supplied content and metadata.

**Inputs:** Repository, optional pull request number, task, epic or planning-discussion kind, body file and selected title, head or base changes, and, for a created delivery pull request, its delivery issue identity, the repository setting confirmed for the session and a link-snapshot destination.

1. For creation, run [Open Task Pull Request](#open-task-pull-request), [Open Epic Pull Request](#open-epic-pull-request) or [Open Discussion Pull Request](#open-discussion-pull-request) for the supplied kind, body, title, head and base, preserving epic and discussion draft state.
   - For a task or epic pull request, apply [Link Pull Request to Issue](#link-pull-request-to-issue) with it, the supplied delivery issue, that confirmed setting and the snapshot destination, meeting [Issue Links](#issue-links).
2. For an existing pull request, run [Patch Pull Request Body](#patch-pull-request-body), [Retitle Pull Request](#retitle-pull-request) or [Retarget Pull Request](#retarget-pull-request) for the supplied changes, preserving other fields.
3. Re-read through [Read Pull Request State](#read-pull-request-state).
4. Return the saved state or discrepancy.

### Fields

#### Issue Links

- GitHub shows the link in the pull request's Development field and in the issue's Linked pull requests field, which the project board reads.
- A task pull request links the task's issue, and a review pull request links its epic's issue.
- The link is addressed by issue, so a pull request whose work carries no issue links nothing. A task pull request delivering rows that have no issue of their own is the whole of what stays unlinked.
- The link is stored on the pull request. It holds on any base branch and on a pull request that has merged, and a later body edit leaves it standing.
- A linked issue remains open until its criteria and delivery requirements hold and every Development-linked pull request is merged.
- The field is the whole of the relation: neither body links the other. The pull request's References carry its sources, and the issue it delivers is not among them.
- A pull request with a delivery issue but no Development link is uncited.

### Commands

#### Open Discussion Pull Request

Opens a draft for the supplied planning branch and body.

**Inputs:** Repository owner and name, title, planning branch, target branch and body file.

```bash
gh api --method POST 'repos/<owner>/<repository>/pulls' -f title='<title>' -f head='<planning-branch>' -f base='<target-branch>' -F body=@'<body-file>' -F draft=true
```

**Example:**

```bash
gh api --method POST repos/m2ux/workflow-server/pulls -f title='Queue Planning: Scope and Delivery' -f head=planning/queue -f base=engineering -F body=@discussion.md -F draft=true
```

#### Retarget Pull Request

Points a pull request at another base branch, such as its epic's base branch.

**Inputs:** Repository, pull request number and target branch.

```bash
gh api --method PATCH 'repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<pull-request-number>' -f base='<target-branch>' --jq .base.ref
```

**Example:**

```bash
gh api --method PATCH 'repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/950' -f base='i07/e00/main' --jq .base.ref
```

#### Fetch Pull Request

Appends one pull request, as one JSON line, to the supplied file.

**Inputs:** Repository, pull request number and destination JSON-lines file.

```bash
gh api 'repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<pull-request-number>' --jq . >> '<pull-request-records-file>'
```

**Example:**

```bash
gh api 'repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/439' --jq . >> prs.json
```

#### Retitle Pull Request

Replaces a pull request's title.

**Inputs:** Repository, pull request number and complete title.

```bash
gh api --method PATCH 'repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<pull-request-number>' -f title='<title>' --jq .title
```

**Example:**

```bash
gh api --method PATCH 'repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/950' -f title='[I07:E00] Purpose' --jq .title
```

#### Open Task Pull Request

Creates a pull request from a unit's branch to its epic base.

**Inputs:** Repository, title, task head, epic base and populated body file.

- Supply the epic prefix and purpose as title, the task branch as head, the epic base as base, and the complete body file.

```bash
gh api --method POST 'repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls' -f title='<title>' -f head='<task-branch>' -f base='<epic-base>' -F 'body=@<body-file>' --jq .html_url
```

**Example:**

```bash
gh api --method POST 'repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls' -f title='[I07:E00] Purpose' -f head='i07/e00/w01-purpose' -f base='i07/e00/main' -F body=@body.md --jq .html_url
```

#### Open Epic Pull Request

Creates the draft pull request from an epic base to its long-lived target.

**Inputs:** Repository, title, epic head, long-lived base and populated review body file.

- Supply the epic prefix and name as title, the epic base as head, its long-lived branch as base, and the populated review body file.
- `draft` is true, including when the work is already complete.

```bash
gh api --method POST 'repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls' -f title='<title>' -f head='<epic-base>' -f base='<long-lived-base>' -F draft=true -F 'body=@<body-file>' --jq .html_url

```

#### Patch Pull Request Body

Replaces a pull request's body.

**Inputs:** Repository, pull request number and complete populated body file.

- The file is the whole body. The issue a pull request delivers is linked on the pull request itself, so this call leaves that link standing.

```bash
gh api --method PATCH 'repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<pull-request-number>' -F 'body=@<body-file>' --jq .html_url
```

**Example:**

```bash
gh api --method PATCH 'repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/950' -F body=@pr-950.md --jq .html_url
```

#### Read Development Links

Returns the complete Development relation through authenticated GitHub or an available supported tool.

**Inputs:** Pull request identity and authenticated access.

Read the actual field across every page and state, recording repository and number for each linked issue. Return the links and whether the field was fully readable.

#### Set Development Link

Adds one pull request to an issue's Development relation.

**Inputs:** Pull request identity, issue identity, authenticated access and confirmed repository prerequisite.

Use [GitHub's sidebar linking procedure](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue): in the issue's Development selector, select the pull request's repository and pull request, including a different repository when required. Return the edit result.

#### Remove Development Link

Removes one selected Development relation.

**Inputs:** Pull request and issue identities, authenticated access and the user's decision authorizing removal of the abandoned or incorrect link.

Deselect the supplied relation in the authenticated Development selector and save the edit. Return the edit result.

#### Write Pull Request Links

Saves complete observed Development-linked issues as a JSON array.

**Inputs:** One complete relation per pull request, with all repository and number pairs, and destination link-snapshot file.

Write the supplied relations in this shape. Substitute numbers as JSON integers. Include each pull request and all its linked issues; use an empty array for a complete relation with no linked issues. Each repository is the one belonging to that pull request or issue.

```text
[
  {
    "repo": "<pull-request-owner>/<pull-request-repo>",
    "number": <pull-request-number>,
    "closingIssuesReferences": [{"repo": "<issue-owner>/<issue-repo>", "number": <issue-number>}]
  }
]
```

**Example payload:**

```json
[
  {
    "repo": "owner/repo",
    "number": 950,
    "closingIssuesReferences": [{"repo": "owner/repo", "number": 637}]
  }
]
```

#### Save Pull Request Snapshot

Saves one complete pull request response, replacing the destination file.

**Inputs:** Repository, pull request number and destination JSON file.

```bash
gh api 'repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<pull-request-number>' > '<pull-request-json-file>'
```

**Example:**

```bash
gh api 'repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/980' > epic-pr.json
```

#### Fetch Pull Request Reviews

Saves every review on one pull request.

**Inputs:** Repository, pull request number and destination file.

```bash
gh api --paginate 'repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<pull-request-number>/reviews?per_page=100' > '<reviews-file>'
```

**Example:**

```bash
gh api --paginate 'repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/980/reviews?per_page=100' > reviews.json
```

#### Fetch Pull Request Files

Saves the paths a pull request changes.

**Inputs:** Repository, pull request number and destination path-list file.

```bash
gh api --paginate 'repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<pull-request-number>/files' --jq '.[].filename' > '<changed-paths-file>'
```

**Example:**

```bash
gh api --paginate 'repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/950/files' --jq '.[].filename' > changed-files.txt
```

## Initiative Issue Body

### Operations

#### *Draft* Initiative Issue Body

One initiative body, scoped to one proposal.

**Inputs:** Scoped proposal, confirmed goal clauses, requirement sources, epic summaries and output path.

1. Populate the body from the [Template](#template-2) into a local file at the supplied output path.
   - That file must be the source for every later edit.
   - All populated fields must meet [Fields](#fields-4).
2. Derive the Problem and Non-Goals from the proposal this initiative is scoped to.
   - The Problem must meet [Problem and Proposal](#problem-and-proposal).
   - Each Non-Goal must meet [Non-Goals](#non-goals).
3. Write the acceptance criteria before the Work Breakdown, so each row's Coverage can cite them.
   - Each criterion must come from a confirmed clause and meet [Initiative Acceptance Criteria](#initiative-acceptance-criteria).
   - The criteria must come from the requirements sources the proposal references. Where the proposal references none, they must come from the proposal's body alone.
4. Populate the shared table through [Write Issue Table](#write-issue-table).
5. Fill the initiative-specific cells.
   - Each row must meet [Work Breakdown](#work-breakdown).
   - An item a test cannot observe must stay named as [Coverage Reports](#coverage-reports) define.

#### *Validate* Initiative Body

The body's local format and field findings.

**Inputs:** Initiative JSON, every linked epic JSON, source evidence and output file.

1. Apply [Validate Issue Body](#validate-issue-body) with the current body, local [Fields](#fields-4), supplied related evidence and output file, supplying each linked epic as `--epic`.
2. Use its current title for the initiative row.
3. Include excluded names in Problem and Proposal and criterion/source departures in the findings.
4. Return the corrected body, mechanical diff and unresolved findings for the caller.

#### *Read* Requirement Sources

The requirements evidence used to validate an initiative's criteria.

**Inputs:** Initiative References, checkout, authenticated source access and destination files.

1. Read each local source at its checkout path.
2. For a pinned GitHub blob, run [Fetch Source](#fetch-source) with its repository, path, pinned revision and output file.
3. Fetch other URLs through the harness's web access.
4. Record an unreadable or empty source as a [Sources](#sources) finding; its criteria remain unevaluated.
5. Return each source's contents and identity with those findings.

### Fields

#### Template

````markdown
## Overview

{{One paragraph: what the initiative achieves, stated as the end state. Name the goal the reviews will test against.}}

## Problem

{{One sentence on the friction, then one bullet per facet. Each bullet opens with a bold statement, and its body is on the next line.}}

- **{{Facet}}.**
  {{The evidence.}}

## Proposal

- **{{Move}}.**
  {{What is done, within two lines.}}

## Work Breakdown

| Epic | Description | Coverage | Depends on | Done |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [E00](https://github.com/{{OWNER}}/{{REPO}}/issues/{{EPIC_ISSUE}}) | {{The epic's title name, the part before the colon}} | AC{{n}}, AC{{m}} | {{Earlier epic}} | |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC1.** {{One invariant. It is specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. It carries no stale count. It names no initiative, epic, task, or issue. It states what the initiative achieves as a whole, and it ends by naming its instrument.}}

## Non-Goals

- {{One succinct sentence on what this initiative does not do. It names no initiative, epic, task or issue, and no owner.}}

## References

- **R1.** [{{Title}}]({{URL}}) — {{What the reader finds there.}}
- **R2.** **Source.** [{{Title}}]({{URL}}) — {{The requirements this initiative's criteria answer to.}}
````

#### Titles

- The title is `[I07] Name: Subtitle`.
- Labels are `type:initiative` and a `theme:*`.
- `I` is the initiative number. Initiatives count from `00`.

#### Problem

- A Problem meets [Problem and Proposal](#problem-and-proposal).

#### Proposal

- A Proposal states the design, as [Problem and Proposal](#problem-and-proposal) defines.
- A Proposal names no epic, task, or acceptance criterion of its own initiative.

#### Work Breakdown

The columns are `Epic | Description | Coverage | Depends on | Done`. The table has no Joins column.

- An epic row's id is the epic, linked to its issue: `[E01](…/issues/937)`.
- An epic row's Description is the epic's title name, and its Coverage names the initiative criteria the epic serves.
- An epic row is complete when its issue is closed as completed.
- Depends on names epics only. A cell that names a task fails. Name a prerequisite epic only when every task or joined unit in the dependent epic requires every task in that prerequisite epic, directly or through its dependencies. The consumed output and the work producing it establish that requirement. Dependencies on selected tasks remain in the task tables. An edge another named whole-epic prerequisite already implies is omitted.
- An initiative dependency that only some tasks need, or that requires only part of its prerequisite epic, is overbroad. The output and its producing tasks establish the edge.
- An epic depending on a later epic is a backward reference.
- Epic numbering meets [Numbering](#numbering).

#### Initiative Acceptance Criteria

An initiative criterion meets the [shared acceptance criteria](#shared-acceptance-criteria) and [Requirement Characteristics](#requirement-characteristics), and:

- **No counts.**
  An initiative criterion carries no counts or figures, which go stale: it measures against a named baseline or check ("against the baseline", "as the budget test measures it"). A figure stays only where it is the criterion's own target, such as a bound it holds to.
- **SMART.**
  Each initiative criterion is specific about what holds, measurable by a named check or baseline, achievable by the epics that cite it, and relevant, tracing to a clause and to the Problem. It is time-bound by a release tag or another named milestone outside the initiative's own work, where one exists, and otherwise by the epics that cite it.
- **Local.**
  An initiative criterion names no initiative, epic, task or issue, and is solution-agnostic. Coverage cells link epics to criteria. One that holds only through another initiative's work is restated as what this initiative achieves, or it is dropped.
- **Whole.**
  An initiative criterion states what the initiative achieves as a whole. One that restates a single epic's criterion is a duplicate: it is raised to what the epics achieve together, or left to the epic.
- **Verified.**
  - An initiative criterion ends by naming its instrument. Which instruments keep a criterion is [Verifiable](#verifiable).
  - An automated test is an end-to-end walk through the real server, a smoke run of an agent against a live server, a live check on a deployed host, or a guard, fixture suite or check that continuous integration runs. The walk, smoke run or live check is preferred where the criterion is about what a run does.
  - A named test that does not exist yet is work the plan holds: a task in the epic whose subject it tests, or a discrete test-infrastructure epic when the tests serve several criteria. That epic's row cites the criteria its tests verify.

#### Non-Goals

- One succinct sentence each on what the initiative does not do, naming no initiative, epic, task or issue, and no owner.

#### References

- A proposal-derived initiative identifies its originating proposal in References with the proposal's exact title and issue URL, labelled as the originating proposal.
- A reference the criteria answer to carries **Source.** after its label: `- **R1.** **Source.** [Title](url) — what it binds`. An unmarked reference is background, and binds no criterion. What a marked one requires of the criteria is [Sources](#sources).
- A cross-initiative overlap is recorded in References. An approved edit to another initiative's issue stays minimal.

#### Sources

A marked source in References is a document the initiative's criteria answer to. The criteria are aligned with it in both directions.

- A criterion that misstates or contradicts a marked source fails the [Correct](#individual) characteristic.
- A requirement a marked source states that no criterion makes true, and no Non-Goal excludes, is a gap.
- A departure from a marked source is corrected in the criterion, unless a Non-Goal records it.
- An epic is aligned against its initiative's marked sources, through the initiative criteria its row covers.
- A marked source that cannot be read leaves its criteria unaligned until it is read.

#### Deferred Debt

A final epic of the initiative holds the debt that initiative's delivery defers. Its title name is `Deferred Debt` and its subtitle names the clear-up it takes; it carries its initiative's theme label and `tech-debt`, and it is raised when the initiative defers its first item. The initiative carries this criterion, which the epic's row covers:

```markdown
- [ ] **ACn.** The technical debt this initiative's delivery defers is fixed, as the Done column of its final epic's Work Breakdown shows.
```

- **It is the initiative's last epic.**
  Its number follows every other epic of the initiative, so the epics in flight are planned and delivered ahead of it and the clear-up competes with none of them.
- **A deferred item is a task row.**
  Each row covers the criterion stating what fixing that item makes true, and those statements are the epic's criteria.
- **It takes the debt its own delivery defers.**
  Debt a unit of this epic finds in resolving its row becomes a further row of the epic, so the clear-up absorbs what fixing it uncovers.
- **It delivers like any other epic.**
  It takes its bases from the long-lived branches its rows change, carries the [corpus audit](#corpus-audit) criterion where those rows change workflow definitions, and remains open until every delivery base has merged and its completion conditions hold.
- **The initiative stays open while it stands.**
  Its row is undelivered and its criterion unticked until the epic closes.

#### Breakdown Prose

Work Breakdown contains its table. Explanatory prose belongs in Proposal. The body does not narrate execution order or how the tables work; Depends on carries the order.

### Commands

#### Fetch Source

Saves one GitHub source at the revision its permalink pins.

**Inputs:** Repository owner and name, source path, pinned revision and destination file. URL-encode the path and revision for the request.

```bash
gh api 'repos/<owner>/<repository>/contents/<source-path>?ref=<revision>' --jq .content | base64 -d > '<source-file>'
```

**Example:**

```bash
gh api 'repos/m2ux/workflow-server/contents/docs/spec.md?ref=4a217fe6' --jq .content | base64 -d > source-R1.md
```

## Epic Issue Body

### Operations

#### *Populate* Epic Issue Body

One epic body and its local validation findings.

**Inputs:** Initiative context, epic scope, draft title and labels, criteria, proposed task rows, available pull request records, corpus branch and output path.

1. Populate the body from the [Template](#template-3) at the supplied output path.
   - Every section must meet [Fields](#fields-5).
   - Shared content must meet the common [body conditions](#fields-10).
2. Populate the shared table through [Write Issue Table](#write-issue-table).
3. Fill the epic-specific cells.
   - Each row must meet [Work Breakdown](#work-breakdown-1).
4. Apply [Build Body Snapshot](#build-body-snapshot) with the draft body, title, labels and existing issue JSON when present.
5. Pass that snapshot, initiative context, available pull request records, corpus branch and output file to [Validate Epic Body](#validate-epic-body).
6. Identify unresolved publication links separately; they remain pending until tracker identities exist.
7. Return the draft rows, their dependency references and the validation findings for the caller's cross-body ordering check.

#### *Validate* Epic Body

The body's local format and field findings.

**Inputs:** Epic JSON, initiative context, current pull request records, corpus branch and output file.

1. Apply [Validate Issue Body](#validate-issue-body) with the current body, local [Fields](#fields-5), supplied related evidence and output file, supplying initiative JSON as `--initiative`, pull requests as `--prs` and corpus branch as `--corpus`.
2. Read reach from each epic pull request's base, through an epic base or initiative branch. Without both pull requests and the corpus branch, reach is unevaluable.
3. Include a missing [Corpus Audit](#corpus-audit) criterion on a corpus-changing epic and any epic criterion no task row delivers in the findings.
4. Return the corrected body, mechanical diff and unresolved findings for the caller.

### Fields

#### Template

````markdown
## Overview

{{One paragraph: what this epic delivers and why it exists within the initiative.}}

## Problem

{{The friction as it is now. Bullets for distinct facets, sub-bullets for several items.}}

#### Titles

- The title is `[I07:E00] Name: Subtitle`. Its prefix matches its row in the initiative table.
- Labels are `type:epic` and its initiative's `theme:*`.
- `E` is the epic within its initiative. Epics count from `00`.
- The prefix separates levels with colons, then a short name, a colon, and a subtitle: `[I07:E06] Reliability Evaluation: Briefs, Measures and the Thresholds That Define Reliable`.

#### Proposal

- A boundary with a sibling epic is plain language.

#### Work Breakdown

New tasks exist as epic rows with their details, discussion and evidence in the epic and planning record. Planning creates no separate task issues. Existing issues hoisted into an epic retain their records and row links when new tasks are planned.

The columns are `Task | Description | Coverage | Depends on | Joins | Done`.

- **Done.**
  A task row is complete when it is delivered, and every criterion its Coverage names is ticked.
- **Row id.**
  The row id is the task, `W01`. `W00` holds preparatory work that must land before the first real task.
- **Description.**
  Each detail beyond the phrase is a criterion stating one invariant.
- **Coverage.**
  Coverage names the epic's criteria the task must meet. Each row claims only criteria its work makes true; it cannot claim a criterion another row delivers alone or one its work cannot meet. A complete task's cell is empty.
- **Depends on.**
  A task row names the rows it depends on. An earlier task in the epic (`W03`, `W04–W09`), a row of an earlier epic (`[E01:W02](…)`), or something outside the initiative (`#750`, `[I05:E00:W02](…)`).
  - A task row names rows, never an epic. It names the row producing each output it consumes (`[E01:W01](…), [E01:W02](…)`), and where the task consumes from every row of an epic that is what establishes the whole-epic reach.
  - Cross-epic dependencies name rows before any issue of the epic is created. Both tables exist, and each edge names the row that produces what the dependent row consumes.
  - A dependency listed twice or already implied by another in the cell is unsound. A task that measures, extends or consumes another task's output depends on it, even when the prose does not say so.
- **Task grain.**
  - A task is one pull request's worth of work.
  - A criterion a merged pull request left unticked belongs to a further task. The further task depends on the delivered task, and its Coverage is that criterion. Criteria one pull request can deliver share one further task. The delivered task's Coverage omits each criterion a further task adopts.
  - A task delivering more than three criteria is split into tasks one pull request each can deliver.
  - A task covers at least one acceptance criterion. A criterion more than one row cites is imprecise: it is split into the invariant each task makes true, and each is cited from the row that delivers it.
  - Every test the work calls for accompanies that task. The content steers which kinds those are, including the project's system test when the work is something that test can exercise. A failure in any test the task carries keeps the task open. None of those tests is a later row.
  - Reusable routines, techniques, and resources are specced, created, and tested before an activity binds them. The grain of an existing resource is in that work.
  - When the behaviour a wired activity produces differs from the behaviour the work expected, that task changes the routine, technique, or resource, and the tests that cover the change, until fit, form, and function hold.
- **Joins.**
  The tasks that share one pull request. Each names the other, and neither depends on the other, directly or through a task outside the pair: the pull request holds their order.
  - Joins are complete before any issue of the epic is created. Every pair of tasks in the epic where neither depends on the other, directly or through another task, is accounted for.
  - A pair that shares a pull request names each other.
  - A pair that does not is named in the planning record, with why.
  - An empty cell is a task that shares no pull request, and only once that record names every such pair.
- **Numbering.**
  Task numbering meets [Numbering](#numbering); a row whose id links a pull request is fixed.
- **Reference form.**
  A table reference uses colons (`E01:W03`, `I05:E00:W02`), and every epic reference links to that epic's issue: `[E01:W03](…/issues/937)`. Prose uses a space (`E01 W03`).

#### Acceptance Criteria

An epic criterion meets the [shared acceptance criteria](#shared-acceptance-criteria). Contradictions between criteria in one epic are findings.

#### Open Questions

Each question holds only what is undecided and has a recommendation in the planning record. A settled point belongs in that record. No question remains when the epic starts.

#### Corpus Audit

An epic whose tasks change workflow definitions carries this criterion, and a final task row delivers it:

```markdown
- [ ] **ACn.** The definitions this epic changes carry no outstanding confirmed finding, as the canon audit's coverage report shows.
```

- **The row is the epic's last.**
  It is named `Canon audit of the changed definitions`, depends on the rows whose definitions it audits, and covers this criterion alone.
- **The audit row is a unit of its own.**
  It is joined to no other row, so its Joins cell is empty.
- **A finding closes by a fix on this epic's branch or by an issue that takes it.**
  Outstanding means neither.
- **Definitions change when a task row's work reaches the branch the corpus lives on.**
  A row that only changes the engine, continuous integration or the workspace does not bring the criterion.

#### Task Delivery

- **Holds.**
  - A unit's record exists and its rows link it before its session starts.
  - A row another session holds is not dispatched.
  - A held row stays held while its session plans and implements. The pull request's link replaces the record's link, which frees the row.
- **Task ids.**
  - An unreserved task awaiting its pull request links its file in the planning record: `[W01](…/w01.md)`. The file name is the task id in lower case.
  - Every link on a task row names that row's id, and the row carries one delivery per long-lived branch its unit changes. A reserved task links only its planning folder: `[W01](…/2026-10-06-943-i07-e00-w01-queue-plan/)`. The folder's README links the work-item file. Releasing the reservation points the row to that file.
  - Once a pull request is open, its link replaces the planning link: `[W01](…/pull/950)`. A unit changing two long-lived branches links the pull request on each: `[W01](…/pull/950), [W01](…/pull/951)`. Further delivery work on one of those branches gets another task row under Task grain. Joined rows each link their shared pull request.
  - The task is delivered when a linked pull request has merged, or its id links a commit.
  - A link to an open pull request does not deliver the task.
  - A linked pull request whose title names another epic delivers the task once it has merged. The mismatch is reported, and the row stays open while a criterion its Coverage names is unticked.
- **Tasks with their own issue.**
  - A task issue belongs to one epic. Its title carries that epic's prefix.
  - When that epic's table has no row for its id, the issue is unplaced. Once the row exists, that epic's planning manages the issue.
  - The row links the pull request, not the issue.
  - The pull request's Development field links the issue as [Issue Links](#issue-links) state.
  - A completed task issue has all criteria verified and every Development-linked pull request merged.
- **Issues backing several tasks.**
  An issue backing several tasks, such as an investigation, is a reference: the epic cites it under References, no row id links it, and its title carries no agent-engineering prefix.
- **Work another issue takes.**
  It leaves the table. Its criteria go with it, or to another row that delivers them.

#### Breakdown Prose

Work Breakdown contains its table. Explanatory prose belongs in Proposal. The body does not narrate execution order or how the tables work; Depends on carries the order.

## Work Item

### Operations

#### *Populate* Work Item

One task's local implementation plan.

**Inputs:** Task id, task scope, epic context, design, the component the implementation extends, supplied criteria and test requirements, and output file.

- Write the supplied task's file from [Template](#template-4), returning its path for registration in the planning record.
  - Its name and content must meet [Identity](#identity) and [Sections](#sections).
  - The supplied component must meet [Component](#component).
  - The test row must meet [Test Coverage](#test-coverage), using the supplied criteria without copying them into the file.

### Fields

#### Template

````markdown
**Component:** {{The one component this task's implementation extends}}

## Overview

{{What this task delivers and why.}}

## Problem

{{The present friction.}}

## Proposal

{{The scene, then the design. Lists of distinct items use bullets.}}

## Work Breakdown

| Part | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Analysis | {{The evidence to gather}} |
| Plan | {{The decisions and design}} |
| Implementation | {{The work to perform}} |
| Review | {{The review of that work}} |
| Test | {{The checks required by the work, including the project's system test when applicable}} |
````

#### Identity

One file per task, named for its id in lowercase, such as `w01.md`. The record's README links each file. The file names no other task and carries no acceptance criteria, Coverage, dependency or Joins; those belong to the epic table.

#### Component

One declaration line ahead of the first heading, naming the single component the Implementation part extends as the path to it in the repository that holds it.

- A task that creates the component names the path it creates.
- A task whose implementation extends more than one component is split into a task for each.

#### Sections

- Component names the component the Implementation part extends, meeting [Component](#component).
- Overview states what the task delivers and why.
- Problem and Proposal meet [Problem and Proposal](#problem-and-proposal); the Proposal starts with the scene.
- Work Breakdown decomposes the work into parts, such as analysis, plan, implementation, review and test. Its columns are Part and Description. The test row names the checks required by the work.

## Dependency Graph

### Operations

#### *Check* Dependencies and Numbering

The task graph and the row numbers it permits, checked and renumbered across the supplied bodies.

**Inputs:** Initiative and epic bodies or local drafts, the work-item file of each task that has one, current pull request records, confirmed numbering maps when any, the caller's change allowance when it has one, and explicitly authorized outside-initiative files.

1. Use the supplied local drafts when reviewing unpublished work.
   - For published issues, fetch the initiative and each epic body with [Read Tracker Issue](#read-tracker-issue).
   - Run [Check Dependencies](#check-dependencies) with the initiative body, every epic body and every supplied work-item file.
2. Resolve each finding, as [Check Plan Change Autonomy](#check-plan-change-autonomy) returns it for the supplied allowance: an automatic correction is taken, and a held one is settled as [Held Change](#held-change) states.
   - Name the producing row for each consumed output, meeting [Edges](#edges), replacing an epic a task row names with the rows the task consumes.
   - Read tasks for implied consumption edges.
   - Account for every independent pair as [Joins](#joins) states.
   - Account for every contending pair as [Component Contention](#component-contention) states: the proposed map separates the two epics by a number, or the contending rows move into one epic.
   - Resolve backward references by moving work to the epic owning its inputs, or removing duplicate work already owned there. Work claimed twice has one owner and a boundary in both bodies.
3. Renumber the confirmed maps, preserving the numbers [Numbering Map](#numbering-map) protects.
   - For a confirmed epic map, run [Renumber Epics](#renumber-epics) with current pull request records and every affected body.
   - For a confirmed task map, run [Renumber Tasks](#renumber-tasks) with the initiative and epic identities, owning epic body, confirmed old-to-new task-number map and every affected body file.
   - Re-sort rewritten tables.
   - Inspect every reported range.
   - Search prose for references the script cannot see.
   - Repeat Check Dependencies after each edge or numbering change until it reports no problem.
   - Record the printed longest chains and each printed contending pair in the planning record.
   - Return the checked bodies, the proposed [Epic Priority](#epic-priority) map and unresolved findings to the caller; do not publish a failed renumbering.

### Fields

#### Edges

A task edge names the producing row for each output the depending row consumes. An edge a task's prose implies is carried explicitly.

- **An edge names rows, never an epic.**
  A row naming an epic gates its task on every row of that epic, including the rows it consumes nothing from, which is how a [whole-epic edge](#whole-epic-edges) the rows do not justify reaches the initiative.
- **A task consuming from every row of an epic names the producing row for each output.**
  An edge another in the cell already implies is dropped, so a prerequisite chain is named by its last row, and the whole-epic reach is what the rows establish either way.
- **An entry that cannot resolve is a permanent condition, not a prerequisite to come.**
  An entry naming no row and linking no issue, naming an issue the run was not given, or naming a row the epic it points to does not carry, cannot resolve. Every tool reading the cell names the entry as written, leaves the row where it stands rather than placing it as work still to come, and exits nonzero.

#### Whole-Epic Edges

An initiative Depends on cell takes the epics it derives, as [Work Breakdown](#work-breakdown) states. It derives one only where every row of the dependent epic requires every row of the prerequisite, through the task edges alone: a task row names rows, so no cell can assert a whole epic that the rows do not already establish.

- **The edge is the coarsest gate the plan has.**
  It holds the dependent epic until the prerequisite closes, not until the row it consumes merges, and it drops the dependent a [priority](#epic-priority) number, so the board keeps it out of Ready while the prerequisite runs.
- **Its cost is why it is derived and never written.**
  A narrower dependency stays in the task graph, where it gates the row that consumes the output rather than the epic around it.

#### Epic Priority

The map proposes one positive integer for each epic supplied, derived from the whole-epic edges and the components its rows declare. Epics sharing a number start together, so the number asserts they can run in parallel, and it holds a set only where both of these do.

- **Prerequisite depth establishes when an epic may start.**
  An epic with no prerequisite epic, one whose tasks are not yet written among them, carries the largest number, and each other epic takes one less than the smallest its prerequisites carry.
- **Component contention establishes whether it can.**
  An epic holding a row that contends with a row of an epic of the same depth takes the number below that depth, and the epics depending on it follow it down, as [Component Contention](#component-contention) states.

#### Component Contention

Two task rows in different epics whose work items declare one [component](#component) contend. Concurrent epics are two bases and two pull requests, so one component written from both is a merge conflict.

- Rows of one epic are out of scope: they land on one base, in the order Depends on and [Joins](#joins) set, so one component written twice is a rebase on that base rather than a conflict between two of them.
- A contending pair is answered by the number that separates its epics, or by moving the rows into one epic.

#### Joins

Every pair of tasks in an epic where neither depends on the other is named in the epic's Joins, or accounted for in the planning record.

- **Both resolutions are stated where the pair is reported.**
  Naming the pair in Joins asserts one pull request; the record entry says why there are two. A report naming only the first makes the assertion the cheaper answer.
- **The record is read, so the second resolution closes the line.**
  A record file gives each pair a line of its own naming its two ids, which is the form a joins artifact takes, and the pair leaves the report. A line naming more rows than that is prose about them and accounts for none, so no enumeration empties the report. What remains is the set named in neither.

#### Numbering Map

A comma-separated list of `<old-number>:<new-number>` pairs assigning each old number one distinct new number. A number a pull request already names is preserved, and a row a pull request names is not renumbered. A source absent from the supplied files, or a duplicate destination, is refused.

### Commands

#### Check Dependencies

Checks the task dependency graph across the epics given, and with `I=` the initiative's Depends on cells.

**Inputs:** Initiative body file, each epic id with its body file, each task id with its work-item file, and each planning-record file accounting for independent pairs.

- Keep `I=` for the initiative. Repeat the `<epic-id>=<epic-body-file>` argument once per epic, the `<epic-id>:<task-id>=<work-item-file>` argument once per work item, and `R=<record-file>` once per record.
- The command runs in `<workspace>` while body files are kept outside the repository, so pass each one as an absolute path.

- Initiative edges follow the [whole-epic prerequisite rule](#work-breakdown); narrower dependencies stay in the task graph.
- It also reports dependencies listed twice or already implied, and Joins pairs.
- It prints each pair of tasks in an epic where neither depends on the other, the two do not name each other in Joins, and no `R=` record accounts for the pair. Each line names both resolutions, as [Joins](#joins) states. A record accounts for a pair by naming both ids on one of its lines, and an `R=` file it cannot read is a problem.
- An entry it cannot resolve is a problem naming the entry as written, as [Edges](#edges) states. Its second clause says what this run could not find, which is the epics it was given.
- It prints each pair of rows in different epics whose work items declare one component, meeting [Component Contention](#component-contention), and names the rows it was given no work item for, so a partial report says what it passed over.
- A task row naming an epic rather than the rows it consumes is a problem, as [Edges](#edges) states. That row still reaches the epic's rows, so a body carrying the retired form is reported once rather than taking its initiative's gates down with it.
- It reads a declared component without its link, a wrapping code span, a trailing full stop or a leading `./`, and reports a work item it cannot read.
- It prints the proposed [Epic Priority](#epic-priority) of each epic, largest first.
- It reads bodies from [Read Tracker Issue](#read-tracker-issue), or local drafts.

```bash
cd "<workspace>" && "<workspace>/scripts/sbx" python3 skills/work-planner/scripts/deps.py 'I=<initiative-body-file>' '<epic-id>=<epic-body-file>' '<epic-id>:<task-id>=<work-item-file>' 'R=<record-file>'
```

**Example:**

```bash
cd "<workspace>" && "<workspace>/scripts/sbx" python3 skills/work-planner/scripts/deps.py I=/drafts/live-936.md E00=/drafts/live-943.md E01=/drafts/live-937.md E00:W01=/drafts/e00/w01.md E01:W01=/drafts/e01/w01.md R=/records/joins.md
```

#### Renumber Tasks

Renumbers one epic's tasks by the map given, in the files given.

**Inputs:** Initiative number, epic number, epic body file, task-number map and affected body files.

- `<task-number-map>` is a comma-separated list of `<old-number>:<new-number>` pairs. Pass each affected body file as a separate argument.

- It renumbers `<epic-id> Wxx` and `<epic-id>:Wxx` everywhere, and bare `Wxx` inside that epic's own body. **Example:** for `E01`, the qualified forms are `E01 Wxx` and `E01:Wxx`.
- The map assigns each old task number a distinct new number. A source absent from the files or a duplicate destination is refused.
- Append `--outside` followed by each explicitly authorized outside-initiative body file when supplied; only this initiative's prefixed references change there.
- Only rows no pull request names may be renumbered. Inspect the rewritten files before publishing them.

```bash
cd "<workspace>" && "<workspace>/scripts/sbx" python3 skills/work-planner/scripts/renumber.py --initiative '<initiative-number>' --epic '<epic-number>' --own '<epic-body-file>' --tasks '<task-number-map>' '<affected-body-file>'
```

**Example:**

```bash
cd "<workspace>" && "<workspace>/scripts/sbx" python3 skills/work-planner/scripts/renumber.py --initiative 07 --epic 1 --own live-937.md --tasks 7:3,3:5 live-*.md
```

#### Renumber Epics

Renumbers an initiative's epics across supplied body files.

**Inputs:** Initiative number, current pull request records, confirmed epic-number map, body files and explicitly authorized outside-initiative files when present.

- The map is a comma-separated list of `<old-number>:<new-number>` pairs. Pass each body file as a separate argument; append `--outside` followed by each outside-initiative file when supplied.
- Files are rewritten in place. Outside files change only references carrying this initiative's prefix; links retain their targets. A collision or a number already named by a pull request is refused.

```bash
cd "<workspace>" && "<workspace>/scripts/sbx" python3 skills/work-planner/scripts/renumber.py --initiative '<initiative-number>' --prs '<pull-request-records-file>' --map '<epic-number-map>' '<body-file>'
```

**Example:**

```bash
cd "<workspace>" && "<workspace>/scripts/sbx" python3 skills/work-planner/scripts/renumber.py --initiative 07 --prs prs.json --map 6:0,0:1 live-936.md live-943.md
```

## Goal Trace

### Operations

#### *Review* Initiative Goal

The draft checked against the initiative outcomes.

**Inputs:** Current initiative and epic bodies or drafts, confirmed goal clauses, marked requirement sources, and the supplied epic format results.

1. Take the goal the user stated and confirmed, as clauses, each an outcome someone could observe.
2. Build the [Trace Table](#trace-table) from those clauses, the initiative criteria, the epics whose Coverage cells cite them and the epic criteria that deliver them.
   - Every goal clause has an initiative criterion that makes it true.
   - Every initiative criterion is delivered by an epic, and that epic's criteria make the criterion wholly true.
   - Every initiative criterion traces to a goal clause.
   - Remove one that traces to none, or put that scope to the user.
   - Record any criterion no task row delivers as a gap from the supplied epic format results.
3. Apply [Read Requirement Sources](#read-requirement-sources) with the initiative References, checkout, authenticated access and output files.
   - Extend the trace table with the source requirement each criterion answers to. Each unmatched requirement, each criterion that departs from the one it cites, and each source that could not be read is a gap [Sources](#sources) names.
4. Check each criterion against the [shared acceptance criteria](#shared-acceptance-criteria) and [Initiative Acceptance Criteria](#initiative-acceptance-criteria).
5. Apply [Build Body Snapshot](#build-body-snapshot) for each supplied local draft with its title, labels and existing identity when present.
   - Use the returned initiative and epic JSON for [Validate Initiative Body](#validate-initiative-body) with the initiative JSON, every linked epic's current JSON, source evidence and output file.
   - Incorporate its local findings into this review.
6. Apply [Check Outside Threats](#check-outside-threats).
7. Rank the gaps, meeting [Gaps](#gaps).
   - Flag the few that most threaten the goal.
   - Record the trace table in the [planning record](#planning-record), or give it to the user when the change has none.
   - Return the trace and ranked findings to the caller.

#### *Check* Outside Threats

An item the draft leaves open is a gap.

**Inputs:** Current initiative and epic bodies or drafts, and the artifacts and consumers the plan changes.

1. Check for anything outside the plan that reads, builds or ships what the plan changes or removes.
2. Check for a skip, a fallback, or a fail-closed path that hides a violation.
3. Check that done has a threshold, a baseline, and an instrument that is independent of the thing measured. The baseline is fixed before the plan changes what it measures.
4. Check for skew between an artifact the plan produces and an implementation that reads it.
5. Check for a change elsewhere that alters the ground the plan stands on.
   - Return the evidenced threats and gaps to [Review Initiative Goal](#review-initiative-goal).

### Fields

#### Trace Table

| Goal clause | Initiative criteria | Epics | Epic criteria | Source requirement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The outcome the user confirmed | The criteria that make the clause true | The epics whose Coverage cells cite those criteria | The epic criteria that deliver them | The requirement the criterion answers to |

Every clause, criterion and epic the initiative holds occupies a row. A cell with no entry is a gap, not an omission.

#### Gaps

A gap is a clause no criterion makes true, a criterion no epic delivers, a criterion tracing to no clause, a criterion no task row delivers, an unmatched source requirement, a criterion departing from the source it cites, a source that could not be read, or a threat the draft leaves open. Gaps are ranked, and the few that most threaten the goal are flagged.

## Review Finding

### Operations

#### *Populate* Review Finding

One finding verified against its supplied source.

**Inputs:** Area, severity, problem, proposed solution, source text and file:line, decision requirement and any confirmed answer.

1. Verify the problem against the supplied source.
2. If evidence is missing or contradictory, return that finding for the caller to resolve.
3. Populate the finding with its source quotation.
   - It must meet [Finding Content](#finding-content) and [Decision State](#decision-state).
4. Return the finding and any pending decision.

#### *Report* Review Finding

The verified findings presented for resolution.

**Inputs:** Area, severity, problem, solution and source evidence for each finding.

1. Apply [Populate Review Finding](#populate-review-finding) with the area, severity, problem, solution and source evidence.
   - Resolve any evidence gap before reporting it.
   - Group the returned findings by area.
2. Put each pending decision to the user, one question at a time.
   - Wait for the answer.
   - Record the confirmed answer on the finding, meeting [Decision State](#decision-state).
   - Return each confirmed resolution to the caller for application to its selected issue kind. A pending decision returns without applying a change.

### Fields

#### Finding Content

Each finding has an area, severity, one problem/solution pair and a source quotation with file and line. The source establishes the stated problem. Findings are grouped by area when presented together.

#### Decision State

A finding identifies whether it needs a user decision and records any supplied answer. An unanswered decision remains pending.

## Repository Labels

### Operations

#### *Ensure* Repository Labels

The required label definitions available for issue publication.

**Inputs:** Repository and required label names, colours and descriptions.

1. Run [List Labels](#list-labels) for the repository.
2. Compare the returned labels with the supplied required names.
3. Run [Create Label](#create-label) for each absent required definition.
4. Return the available labels; an unknown definition is a finding for the caller to resolve before publication.

### Commands

#### List Labels

Lists the labels that exist in the repository.

**Inputs:** Repository.

```bash
gh api "repos/<owner>/<repo>/labels?per_page=100" --jq '.[].name'
```

#### Create Label

Creates the label specified by its name, colour and description.

**Inputs:** Repository, label name, colour and description.

```bash
gh api --method POST 'repos/<owner>/<repo>/labels' -f name='<label>' -f color='<hex-colour>' -f description='<description>' --jq .name
```

## Issue Body

### Operations

#### *Write* Issue Table

The shared table, before a kind fills its cells.

**Inputs:** Current body, the kind's table columns and supplied row data.

1. Populate the shared Done, Coverage and Depends on cells from the supplied row data.
   - The columns must match the kind's table.
   - The shared cells must meet [Tables](#tables).
2. Read the finished table against [Tables](#tables), [Numbering](#numbering), and [Reference form](#reference-form). A Depends on cell that holds prose fails [Tables](#tables). Numbering that does not follow start order is advisory, as [Numbering](#numbering) states.

#### *Check* Round of Edits

The shared check after a round of edits.

**Inputs:** Changed issue bodies, their kind's field conditions and format inputs.

1. Check each section of the issue against the field conditions for its kind and against [Fields](#fields-10) in this file.
2. Run [Check Body Format](#check-body-format) on every issue the round changed.

#### *Validate* Issue Body

One body checked against its supplied kind and template.

**Inputs:** Issue JSON, kind field conditions, required related evidence and output body file.

1. Run [Check Body Format](#check-body-format) with the supplied issue JSON, kind inputs and output file as `--fix`.
2. Review the body against the supplied field conditions.
3. Return the [Format Findings](#format-findings), mechanical diff and field findings, including missing sections, extra sections, wrong-kind layout, historical narration and criteria that fail their named instrument. A mechanical correction preserves wording; new content and scope decisions require caller-supplied resolutions.

#### *Build* Body Snapshot

A local issue-shaped record for body validation.

**Inputs:** Current body file, title, labels, optional existing issue JSON and destination JSON path.

1. Write the body's exact text, title and labels to the destination as JSON.
2. Preserve the existing issue's identity and state when supplied.
3. For an unpublished draft, use `number: null` and `state: "open"`; labels are strings or objects with a name.
4. Return the JSON path for validation. No tracker issue is created by this operation.

### Fields

#### Titles

- **Titles.**
  - A title is a short name, a colon, and a subtitle stating the outcome.
  - The name is two or three words and the subtitle a succinct summary of at most ten, in title case.
  - A prefixed title separates its levels with colons, then the name.
- **Bodies.**
  - Every body keeps the section order of its kind template and the columns of that kind's table.
  - Fill each `{{…}}` and delete a section the template marks as optional when it has nothing to say.
- **Code references.**
  A body references code as a link on the words it supports, a permalink pinned to a commit with its line anchors, never a bare `path:line`: `the [extrinsic type](…/blob/<sha>/runtime/src/lib.rs#L1231-L1232)`.
- **Succinct items.**
  Each Problem and Proposal item, and each of its sub-bullets, is at most two lines. A bold opener does not count toward the two. Several distinct points go in a bulleted list, never packed into those two lines.
- **Bold leads.**
  - A Problem or Proposal item that opens with a bold statement puts its body on the next line, indented under the bullet:

    ```markdown
    - **Length is the only check on entry.**
      The data source decodes the key and never checks its value.
    ```

  - A bulleted item with sub-bullets keeps the line introducing them on its bold statement's line:

    ```markdown
    - **Framing is undocumented.** Nothing describes:
      - the runtime's extrinsic type;
    ```
- **Labels.**
  - Add `enhancement`, `bug` and `tech-debt` as they apply.
  - **Example.**  workflow-server adds `workflows`.
  - Only labels that exist are applied.

#### Problem and Proposal

- **Friction.**
  A Problem states the friction as it is now. Its evidence is a count or a code link for that friction. A Problem does not describe the plan.
- **Plan ids.**
  A Problem or Proposal names no epic, task or acceptance criterion of its own initiative. The Work Breakdown table holds those references; a sibling boundary is plain language.
- **Evidence that may be cited.**
  Code, a merged pull request, and an issue outside this initiative may be cited.

#### Shared Acceptance Criteria

An acceptance criterion meets these. A kind adds its own under its Acceptance Criteria.

- States an end state, not an activity.
- Names or implies the instrument that observes it: a test, a guard, a command or a measure.
- Is unambiguous, so two readers agree on whether it holds.
- Meets [Requirement Characteristics](#requirement-characteristics).
- **One invariant.**
  Each criterion states a single condition that holds or does not. One joining several is split, and the Coverage cells cite the new ones. A condition over a list of subjects is one condition.

##### Verifiable

- Subjective wording is an observable pass or fail, or the criterion is absent.
- A fact that inspection, analysis, demonstration, or test can check is kept, such as every option having a description.
- A judgment about meaning, such as a claim that a description states what choosing means, is subjective wording.
- An item none of those methods can observe is named as [Coverage Reports](#coverage-reports) define, and it stays named there.

#### Tables

- **Done.**
  The last column. Its cell is empty while the row is open, and a tick, ✓, when the row is complete.
- **Description.**
  A short phrase naming what the row delivers, at most eight words, with no list, semicolon or detail.
- **Coverage.**
  The acceptance criteria the row delivers, `AC2, AC5`, and nothing else. Every criterion is delivered by at least one row.
- **Depends on.**
  References only, with no prose, and only what no other entry in the cell already implies.

#### Numbering

Rows are numbered in the order they can start, so every dependency points to an earlier row. Numbering that does not follow start order is advisory.

Work a pull request names keeps its number. Renumbering touches only a row no pull request names.

#### Reference Form

Tables write references with colons, the form the scripts read. Prose uses a space.

#### Body

- **Stale references.**
  A row number, issue link or decision wording agrees with the current plan.
- **Body.**
  A body states the plan as it is. It carries no change narrative. How the plan evolved belongs in the planning record and in commit and pull request bodies.

#### Stale References

Task and epic numbers, issue links and wording must agree with the current decisions and bodies. References to superseded decisions are findings.

#### References

An issue's References section does not link issues or pull requests on the same board.

#### Coverage Reports

- **Unobservable items.**
  An item a test cannot observe is named in the plan or the coverage report. It stays in the report.
- **The check matches the criterion.**
  - A file or string check counts as coverage only when the criterion is a fact about that file.
  - A criterion about a run is covered by a run that shows it.
- **The specified set.**
  A coverage report lists every acceptance criterion the work under review is specified to cover.

#### Format Findings

- **Fixed.**
  Structural changes preserve the wording and are present in the returned body file, with a body diff.
- **Apply.** Title or label changes for the caller to publish on the issue.
- **Decide.** Missing content or a judgement for the caller to resolve.

### Commands

#### Check Body Format

Checks one issue against its template, and with `--fix` writes the body with the mechanical fixes made.

**Inputs:** Issue JSON, local output body file and the additional format inputs supplied by the kind.

- The format reader takes the template fence from the body artifact and its table columns where present. A body with a Work Breakdown table requires coverage for every criterion.
- The input is one issue JSON. `--fix` names the output body file for mechanical fixes. Further inputs are specified by the calling body procedure.

```bash
cd "<workspace>" && "<workspace>/scripts/sbx" python3 skills/work-planner/scripts/format.py '<issue-json-file>' --fix '<output-body-file>'
```

**Example:**

```bash
cd "<workspace>" && "<workspace>/scripts/sbx" python3 skills/work-planner/scripts/format.py issue.json --fix fixed.md
```

## Epic

### Operations

#### *Check* Epic Prerequisites

The evidence required before starting an epic's work.

**Inputs:** Current initiative and epic bodies, and current issue and base-merge records for every prerequisite the initiative row names.

1. Identify each prerequisite the supplied initiative row names.
2. Apply the initiative's [whole-epic dependency rule](#work-breakdown); a task row's reference to a row of another epic gates that row rather than this epic.
3. Confirm each prerequisite epic is closed as completed and every one of its bases has merged. Missing records leave the prerequisite unconfirmed.
4. Return the [Prerequisite Evidence](#prerequisite-evidence), identifying each confirmed prerequisite and missing condition. Only a confirmed result permits an unstarted epic to be marked Ready, its bases to be created or its task to be dispatched.

### Fields

#### Prerequisite Evidence

Each prerequisite has its issue identity and completion state, expected delivery bases and their merge evidence. The result identifies confirmed and missing conditions for the candidate epic.

## Delivery Branches

### Operations

#### *Prepare* Delivery Bases

The branches a task pull request targets.

**Inputs:** Project checkout, epic identifier, changed long-lived branches and confirmed prerequisite evidence.

1. Run [List Long-Lived Branches](#list-long-lived-branches) with `--project` set to the project checkout.
2. Run [List Epic Bases](#list-epic-bases) for the epic.
3. If `config/branches` is missing or empty:
   - Report the names as unevaluable.
   - Obtain the project's branch names before creating delivery branches.
4. Require the caller's confirmed prerequisite evidence before creating a base. The board status alone supplies no such evidence.
5. Apply [Create Epic Base](#create-epic-base) for each missing base, passing the project checkout, corresponding long-lived branch, epic base name and confirmed prerequisite evidence.

#### *Create* Epic Base

The missing epic branch rooted in its remote long-lived branch.

**Inputs:** Repository checkout, long-lived source branch, missing epic base name and confirmed prerequisite evidence.

1. Require the confirmed prerequisites and a missing destination. Refuse a destination that already exists.
2. Run [Fetch Remote Branch](#fetch-remote-branch) in the supplied repository checkout with the corresponding long-lived source branch, such as `main`.
3. After a successful fetch:
   - Run [Publish Epic Base](#publish-epic-base) with that remote source and the missing epic base name, such as `i07/e00/main`, meeting [Epic Bases](#epic-bases).
   - Return the created branch or the failure.

### Fields

#### Branches

A project states its long-lived branches in `config/branches` at its root, one name per line. A run from a linked worktree reads the statement its main working tree holds.

- **Example.**
  workflow-server's `config/branches` names `docker`, `main`, `workflows` and `workspace`.

#### Epic Bases

- Each long-lived branch an epic changes has a base branch, named for the initiative, the epic and that branch, and rooted in that long-lived branch. Its prerequisite epics are closed as completed with every delivery base merged.
- **Example.**
  An epic base cut from `main` is `i07/e00/main`.
- The base's last segment is its long-lived branch, which gives the target it merges and is merged into.
- Each base is worked in one worktree, named by the base under the worktree directory of the repository's main working tree.
- **Example.**
  `i07/e00/main` merges `main`, and is checked out at `.worktrees/i07/e00/main`.
- Every pull request delivering the epic's tasks targets that epic base.
- A completed epic is delivered by merging each base into its long-lived branch. The epic stays open until every base has merged.

### Commands

#### List Epic Bases

Prints one epic's base branch names, one per line.

**Inputs:** Repository checkout and epic branch prefix.

- A base is `<epic-branch-prefix>/<name>` whose `<name>` is a [long-lived branch](#branches), named as [Epic Bases](#epic-bases) states.
- The prefix has the form `i<initiative-number>/e<epic-number>`. **Example:** `i07/e00`; a corresponding base is `i07/e00/main`.
- The output contains one full base branch name per line.

```bash
git ls-remote --heads origin 'refs/heads/<epic-branch-prefix>/*' | cut -f2 | sed 's|refs/heads/||'
```

**Example:**

```bash
git ls-remote --heads origin 'refs/heads/i07/e00/*' | cut -f2 | sed 's|refs/heads/||'
```

#### List Long-Lived Branches

Prints the long-lived branch names, one per line.

**Inputs:** Project checkout.

- The names meet [Branches](#branches).
- `--project` is any checkout of the project. The names are the ones `config/branches` states in its main working tree, which a linked worktree resolves for itself.
- A missing or empty statement prints `unevaluable:`, names what is missing, and exits 1.

```bash
cd "<workspace>" && "<workspace>/scripts/sbx" python3 skills/work-planner/scripts/sync.py --names --project '<checkout>'
```

#### Fetch Remote Branch

Fetches one source branch from origin.

**Inputs:** Repository checkout and source branch.

```bash
git fetch origin '<source-branch>'
```

#### Publish Epic Base

Creates a remote epic base from the fetched source branch.

**Inputs:** Repository checkout, fetched long-lived source branch, destination epic-base name, confirmed missing destination and prerequisite evidence.

```bash
git push origin 'origin/<source-branch>:refs/heads/<epic-base>'
```

## Plan Change

### Operations

#### *Check* Plan Change Autonomy

One pending change assessed against the run's allowance.

**Inputs:** The pending change, its subject, the option recommended for it, and the allowance the caller was supplied.

1. Match the change to one kind in [Change Kinds](#change-kinds).
2. Return it as automatic where the supplied allowance names that kind, with the supplied recommendation as the option the caller applies.
3. Return it as held otherwise, for the caller to settle as [Held Change](#held-change) states.
   - A change matching no kind is held, as is one matching [Initiative Creation](#initiative-creation).
   - An absent allowance holds every change, so a run the user drives decides nothing on their behalf.

### Fields

#### Allowance

The caller names the change kinds its run applies without asking. A run the user drives directly is supplied none.

#### Change Kinds

| Kind | What It Covers |
| --- | --- |
| Task creation | A new task row, and the task issue that delivers it |
| Epic creation | A new epic, and the initiative row that carries it |
| Migration | Work moved from one issue to another, with the renumbering that move forces |
| Re-prioritisation | A priority label, a queue order or a board status |
| Folded work | Criteria, scope or design added to an existing issue because the work in hand needs it |

An option deciding to leave work where it is changes no plan, so it needs no allowance and takes no entry, unlike a change [held](#held-change) for the user to decide.

#### Initiative Creation

A new initiative is outside every allowance. The work stays where it is, open and unplaced, until the user decides where it belongs.

#### Held Change

A held change is left unapplied and its subject stays as it stands, so the next run sees the same decision. Its entry carries the recommended option, which is what the user is answering.

A run working under an allowance records and reports a held change rather than asking, since the work it was dispatched for does not wait on an answer. A run supplied no allowance puts it to the user.

## Proposal Body

### Operations

#### *Populate* Proposal Body

One proposal body from a confirmed problem and goal.

**Inputs:** Confirmed problem, evidence, goal clauses, boundary and output path.

- Populate the body from the [Template](#template-5) at the supplied output path.
  - The title must meet the shared [Titles](#titles-3) conditions.
  - The Problem must meet the shared [Problem and Proposal](#problem-and-proposal) conditions.
  - All populated fields must meet [Fields](#fields-14), including the required [Sections](#sections-1).

#### *Validate* Proposal Body

The body's local format and field findings.

**Inputs:** Proposal issue JSON and output file.

1. Apply [Validate Issue Body](#validate-issue-body) with the current body, local [Fields](#fields-14), supplied related evidence and output file, using the proposal field conditions and required title and label metadata.
2. Return the corrected body, mechanical diff and unresolved findings for the caller.

### Fields

#### Template

````markdown
## Overview

{{One paragraph: the problem this proposal scopes. Name the goal the clauses state.}}

## Problem

{{One sentence on the friction, then one bullet per facet. Each bullet opens with a bold statement, and its body is on the next line.}}

- **{{Facet}}.**
  {{The evidence.}}

## Goal

- {{A clause: an outcome someone could observe. Not a description of the change.}}

## Non-Goals

- {{One succinct sentence on what this proposal does not do. It names no initiative, epic, task or issue, and no owner.}}

## References

- **R1.** [{{Title}}]({{URL}}) — {{What the reader finds there. Delete the section when there is none.}}
````

#### Titles

- The title is `[P00] Name: Subtitle`.
- The label is `type:proposal`.
- `P` is the proposal number. Proposals count from `00`.

#### Problem

- A Problem meets [Problem and Proposal](#problem-and-proposal).

#### Goal

- Each clause is an outcome someone could observe.
- A clause does not describe the change.

#### Non-Goals

- One succinct sentence each on what the proposal does not do.
- A non-goal names no initiative, epic, task or issue, and no owner.

#### Sections

- Overview, Problem, Goal and Non-Goals are present in that order. References follows when it has content.

## Board

### Operations

#### *Create* Proposals Board

A new proposals board linked to the supplied repository.

**Inputs:** Board owner and repository.

1. Run [Find Board Template](#find-board-template) with the owner and the exact title `Proposals Template`.
2. Use the returned number as the copy source.
3. Run [Copy Board Template](#copy-board-template) with that template number, the owner and the title `Proposals`.
4. Retain the new board number. The copy meets [Proposals](#proposals).
5. Run [Link Board to Repository](#link-board-to-repository) with the owner, new board number and repository.
6. Return the new board number after linking succeeds.

#### *Place* Issue on Board

One issue's membership and initial status.

**Inputs:** Board owner and number, issue id and selected initial status.

1. Run [Fetch Board Fields](#fetch-board-fields) for the Status options, using the caller's supplied board and issue identities.
2. Run [Add Issue to Board](#add-issue-to-board) with the issue id.
3. Run [Set Item Status](#set-item-status) with the caller's selected status and the matching field and option ids.
4. Run [Fetch Board Item](#fetch-board-item) for the saved item.

#### *Locate* Project Board

The board identity matching a supplied purpose or theme.

**Inputs:** Owner and proposals-board purpose or theme title.

1. Run [Find Proposals Board](#find-proposals-board) for proposals, or [Find Theme Board](#find-theme-board) for a theme.
2. Return the identity or an absent-board finding for the caller's selection or creation path.

### Fields

#### Proposals

- The board is titled `Proposals`. It holds proposal issues, the incoming funnel for work that may become an initiative.
- Its copy source is the open board titled `Proposals Template`. That template carries Priority: High, Medium and Low, and its view is a board grouped by Status.
- **Suggested.**
  Raised, and nobody has taken it up. A new proposal lands here, with no assignee.
- **Considering.**
  Someone is weighing the goal, the evidence and the criteria. That person is the assignee.
- **Approved.**
  Qualified to become an initiative. The assignee is the user.
- **Held.**
  Not now. It stays on the board, with no assignee.
- **Declined.**
  It will not become an initiative. It has no assignee.

### Commands

#### Find Board Template

Prints the number of the open board with the supplied exact template title.

**Inputs:** Board owner and template title.

```bash

```

#### Copy Board Template

Copies the supplied template into a new open board with the supplied title and prints its number.

**Inputs:** Board owner, template board number and new board title.

```

#### Set Item Status

Sets one board item's Status.

**Inputs:** Board owner and number, item id, and input file containing the Status field id and selected option id.

The input body names the Status field id and option id from [Fetch Board Fields](#fetch-board-fields): `{"fields":[{"id":<status-field-id>,"value":"<status-option-id>"}]}`. Substitute the field id as a JSON integer and the option id as a JSON string.

**Example payload:** `{"fields":[{"id":419167630,"value":"OPTION"}]}`.

```bash
gh api --method PATCH 'users/<owner>/projectsV2/<board-number>/items/<item-id>' --input '<status-input-file>' --jq .id

# Propose Mode

Scopes one problem: the friction, the evidence, and the boundary, and states the goal as clauses the user confirms. It raises one proposal on the board titled `Proposals`.

Follow the [Procedure](#procedure-1), adhering to [Rules](#rules) and [Conventions](#conventions) and ensure all [Outcomes](#outcomes-1) are met.

## Procedure

1. **Understand the problem.**
   Ask the user until the friction and the boundary are clear.
   - State the goal back as clauses meeting [Goal](#goal).
   - Have the user confirm those clauses.
2. **Gather evidence.**
   - Measure the current state: counts, paths, and file:line.
   - Delegate broad sweeps to parallel sub-agents.
   - Spot-check what they return before recording it.
3. **Draft the body.**
   Apply [Populate Proposal Body](#populate-proposal-body) with the confirmed problem, evidence, goal clauses, boundary and output body path. The local file is the source for the issue.
   - Obtain the proposal's number through [Select Tracker Number](#select-tracker-number) with the proposal prefix letter, and carry it in the title.
   - The goal clauses are the clauses the user confirmed. The Non-Goals are the boundary.
   - The design, the acceptance criteria, and the breakdown belong to a later goal.
4. **Validate.**
   Apply [Validate Proposal Body](#validate-proposal-body) with the draft issue JSON and output file.
   - Resolve each finding.
   - Update the draft.
   - Repeat Validate Proposal Body with the revised JSON and the same output path. Proceed to publication only when validation passes.
5. **Publish.**
   Apply [Ensure Repository Labels](#ensure-repository-labels) with the proposal's required label definitions.
   - Pass the validated body, title and labels to [Save Tracker Issue](#save-tracker-issue), leaving it unassigned.
6. **Confirm placement.**
   Ask whether to add the issue to the proposals board.
   - On acceptance, continue to the place step.
   - On a decline, skip placement and continue to the report step with the issue URL.
   - Wait for an unanswered decision.
7. **Place.**
   Apply [Locate Project Board](#locate-project-board) for proposals.
   - Create an absent board through [Create Proposals Board](#create-proposals-board).
   - Read the saved issue id through [Read Tracker Issue](#read-tracker-issue).
   - Apply [Place Issue on Board](#place-issue-on-board) with that id and initial status Suggested.
   - Leave the issue unassigned.
8. **Report.**
   Give the issue's URL, and the board's when the issue was placed.

## Outcomes

- **A scoped problem.**
  The user has one problem scoped, and has confirmed its goal.
- **One proposal.**
  The user has that problem raised as one proposal.
- **On the proposals board.**
  When the user wants the proposal on the proposals board, it is there, raised, and unassigned.

# Bootstrap

A link whose text opens with a matching [symbol](#symbols) follows the usage instructions and is *not* read as a file.

## Compile

Compile a target file. Run from the skill's directory, which holds `SKILL.md`.

```bash
pf -o <scratch>/<name>.bundle.md <destination>
```

- `<destination>`  The link's destination as written.
- `<name>`  The destination's file name without its suffix.
- `<scratch>`  An existing working directory outside the repository.

> A non-zero exit stops the run and reports `pf`'s diagnostics.

## Symbols

| Symbol | Description | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `↳` | An inline target | [Compile](#compile) it, read the whole bundle and follow the instructions in its preamble. |
| `⇉` | A dispatched target | [Compile](#compile) it, hand the bundle to one sub-agent, with the inputs the request names, to follow the instructions in its preamble, and continue with the result it returns. A dispatched run puts no question to the user: it returns each question, with its context paragraph and options, unanswered to the session that dispatched it. That session puts each returned question to the user, or returns it in turn when it was itself dispatched, then dispatches again with the answers. A step that dispatches for each item of a set in parallel hands every item at once to a sub-agent of its own, with that item's inputs, and continues when all have returned; only the sub-agents that returned questions are dispatched again, with their answers. |

## Requirement Characteristics

The characteristics an acceptance criterion meets, and the characteristics a set of them meets. Condensed from ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018, clauses 5.2.4 to 5.2.7.

### Individual

Each criterion has these characteristics.

- **Necessary.**
  It states a capability, constraint, or quality the work must have. Leaving it out leaves that need unmet, and no other criterion meets it. It applies now.
- **Appropriate.**
  The detail matches the level of the work. It states what holds, and does not lock in a design the need does not require.
- **Unambiguous.**
  It can be read in only one way.
- **Complete.**
  It states the condition fully. Knowing whether it holds does not depend on some other text.
- **Singular.**
  It states one capability, constraint, or quality. Several conditions under which that one thing holds are still one criterion.
- **Feasible.**
  It can be met within the cost, schedule, and technical bounds of the work, at an acceptable risk.
- **Verifiable.**
  Its wording lets the realisation be proved, at the level the criterion is written, by inspection, analysis, demonstration, or test. A measure makes that proof easier.
- **Correct.**
  It states the need it came from, accurately.
- **Conforming.**
  It follows the acceptance-criterion form: an end state, one invariant, and a named instrument.

### A Set

The criteria of one issue, taken together, have these characteristics.

- **Complete.**
  Together they state what the work must achieve. Nothing the set needs is left to be defined later.
- **Consistent.**
  No two conflict or overlap. The same word means the same thing throughout.
- **Feasible.**
  The set can be met within the same cost, schedule, and technical bounds, at an acceptable risk.
- **Comprehensible.**
  A reader can see what the work is expected to achieve, and how that sits with the rest of the plan.
- **Able to be validated.**
  Meeting the set achieves the need the plan states, within its constraints.

### Wording

- **What, not how.**
  A criterion states the condition that holds. A design choice belongs in the Proposal.
- **Bounded words.**
  These make a criterion hard to prove, or open to more than one reading, unless a measure defines them:
  - superlatives, such as best or most;
  - subjective praise, such as easy or robust;
  - vague pronouns, such as it or this;
  - open comparatives, such as better or significant;
  - loopholes, such as if possible or as appropriate;
  - words of totality, such as all, always, or never, unless the set they cover is named;
  - an open-ended promise, such as provide support.
- **Assumptions.**
  An assumption is recorded beside the criterion, in the Problem or the Proposal. It is not written as the criterion.
- **Definitions.**
  A definition is a statement of what a term means. It is not a criterion.
