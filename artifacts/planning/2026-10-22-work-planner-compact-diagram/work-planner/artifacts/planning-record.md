# Planning Record

A planning record is a folder. README.md is its entry point: it answers what the work is, and links to every other artifact the plan produces. Each artifact is the home of its own content. The progress of the work is the theme's project board.

## Operations

### Populate Planning Record

One planning directory and its artifact inventory.

**Inputs:** Record identity, folder path and supplied artifact files and links.

1. Prepare the selected record:
   - For a new record:
     - Create the folder with [Add Planning Record](#add-planning-record).
     - Populate README.md from the [Template](#template).
   - For an existing record:
     - Read its README, retaining its creation date, other artifacts and links.
     - Update only the supplied content.
   - The folder must meet [Layout](#layout).
   - All populated README fields must meet [Fields](#fields).
2. Register the artifact files supplied by the caller, using their chosen names.
   - Each file must have a row meeting [Layout](#layout) and [Artifacts](#artifacts).
   - File content remains supplied by the caller; this operation does not author that artifact's content.

## Fields

### Template

```markdown
# [Descriptive name] — [Month Year]

> [Classifier] · Created [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Executive Summary

[Two paragraphs on the purpose of this work and why it matters.]

## Artifacts

| Artifact | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| [Name](file.md) | What this artifact holds |

## Links

| Resource | Link |
| --- | --- |
| [External reference] | [link] |
```

### Layout

README.md is the one file the folder must hold. Any file beyond README.md is added as the work needs it.

```text
./
├── README.md
└── …
```

Each file beyond README.md is a row in the README's Artifacts.

### Header

One blockquote: the classifier, the day the record was created, and a revised date when the README is updated after the work is done.

### Executive Summary

Two paragraphs: the purpose of this work, and why it matters.

### Artifacts

- One row for every artifact in the record other than README.md, added when the file is produced.
- The link sits on the artifact's name. The row says what the artifact holds, and the artifact is the home of that content.

### Links

External references only: a tracker issue, a parent epic, a pull request. An artifact of this plan is an Artifacts row.

## Commands

### Add Planning Record

Adds the folder for one planning record on the long-lived engineering worktree.

**Inputs:** Engineering worktree and planning-folder path composed from the date, optional issue or pull request number, and slug.

- `<planning-folder-path>` is `artifacts/planning/<yyyy-mm-dd>[-<ref>]-<slug>/`. The date is the day the record is opened.
- `<ref>` is the bare number of the issue or the pull request the record is for. A record for ad hoc work, which has neither, has no ref segment.
- The slug is lowercase words separated by hyphens, a short name of the work.
- The folder's files are the [planning layout](planning-record.md#layout).
- Edits are made on that worktree. The engineering branch takes no further worktree and no branch.

```bash
mkdir -p '<planning-folder-path>'
```

**Example:**

```bash
mkdir -p artifacts/planning/2026-10-15-950-queue-plan
```
